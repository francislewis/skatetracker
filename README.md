skatetracker
============

An Android app for skateboarders that lets them track progress by ticking off tricks they have learnt from a list.
============

##Aim
To have an app that I would use that I think could be helpful to skaters.


I bult the UI on appery.io and wrote JS for it to function. I may re-write it in pure HTML, CSS and JS and port it with phonegap one day.
