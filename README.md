skatetracker
============

An Android app for skateboarders that lets them track progress by ticking off tricks they have learnt from a list.
============

##Aim
To have an app that I would use that I think could be helpful to skaters.


I am going to use HTML, CSS and JS to create this app. I will then port it using <a href="http://phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>.
